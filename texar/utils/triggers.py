    user-defined :attr:`user_state` and does some :attr:`action` when certain
    condition is met. Specifically, the user calls the trigger periodically.

    :meth:`_predicate`, which returns a boolean value indicates whether the
    condition is met. Once the condition is met, the trigger will then execute
    `user_state = action(user_state)` to update the :attr:`user_state`.
    :attr:`user_state` should completely define the current state of the

    There are **2 ways** provided to specify the set of :attr:`steps`:

    1.  :attr:`steps` is a callable. When calling
        `steps(last_called_step, current_step)`, it is assumed to return
        a boolean indicating whether there is at least one `step` in the set
        within the range `(last_called_step, current_step]`. For example,
        :code:`steps = lambda l, r: l // n != r // n` denotes the set
        `{i * n for any integer i}` where `n` is some integer. This option
        enables user to define any set of steps, even an infinite set. Note
        that in this case the trigger will never trigger when being called
        for the first time, because `last_called_step` is undefined at this
        time. User can manually call it to specify an initial step before
        training.

    2.  :attr:`steps` is a `list` or `tuple` containing numbers in ascending
        order. These numbers compose the whole set.
