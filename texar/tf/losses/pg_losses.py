    """Policy gradient loss with logits. Used for discrete actions.

    `pg_loss = reduce( advantages * -log_prob( actions )  )`,
    where `advantages` and `actions` do not back-propagate gradients.

    All arguments except :attr:`logits` and :attr:`actions` are the same with
    :func:`pg_loss_with_log_probs`.

    Args:
        actions: Tensor of shape
            `[(batch_size,) max_time, d_3, ..., d_rank]` and of dtype
            `int32` or `int64`.
            The rank of the Tensor is specified with :attr:`rank`.

            The batch dimension exists only if :attr:`batched` is `True`.

            The batch and time dimensions
            are exchanged, i.e., `[max_time, batch_size, ...]` if
            :attr:`time_major` is `True`.
        logits: Unscaled log probabilities of shape
            `[(batch_size,) max_time, d_3, ..., d_{rank+1}]`
            and dtype `float32` or `float64`.
            The batch and time dimensions are exchanged if `time_major`
            is `True`.
        advantages: Tensor of shape
            `[(batch_size,) max_time, d_3, ..., d_rank]` and
            dtype `float32` or `float64`.
            The batch and time dimensions are exchanged if `time_major`
            is `True`.
        rank (int, optional): The rank of :attr:`actions`.
            If `None` (default), rank is automatically inferred from
            `actions` or `advantages`. If the inference fails,
            `rank` is set to 1 if :attr:`batched` is `False`,
            and set to 2 if :attr:`batched` is `True`.
        batched (bool): `True` if the inputs are batched.
        sequence_length (optional): A Tensor of shape `[batch_size]`.
            Time steps beyond the respective sequence lengths will have zero
            losses. Used if :attr:`batched` is `True`.
        average_across_timesteps (bool): If set, average the loss across
            the time dimension. Must not set `average_across_timesteps`
            and `sum_over_timesteps` at the same time.
        average_across_batch (bool): If set, average the loss across the
            batch dimension. Must not set `average_across_batch`'
            and `sum_over_batch` at the same time.
            Ignored if `batched` is `False`.
        average_across_remaining (bool): If set, average the sequence across the
            remaining dimensions. Must not set `average_across_remaining`'
            and `sum_over_remaining` at the same time. Ignored if
            no more dimensions other than the batch and time dimensions.
        sum_over_timesteps (bool): If set, sum the loss across the
            time dimension. Must not set `average_across_timesteps`
            and `sum_over_timesteps` at the same time.
        sum_over_batch (bool): If set, sum the loss across the
            batch dimension. Must not set `average_across_batch`
            and `sum_over_batch` at the same time.
            Ignored if `batched` is `False`.
        sum_over_remaining (bool): If set, sum the loss across the
            remaining dimension. Must not set `average_across_remaining`
            and `sum_over_remaining` at the same time. Ignored if
            no more dimensions other than the batch and time dimensions.
        time_major (bool): The shape format of the inputs. If `True`,
            :attr:`logits`, :attr:`actions` and :attr:`advantages` must
            have shape `[max_time, batch_size, ...]`. If `False` (default),
            they must have shape `[batch_size, max_time, ...]`.
            Ignored if `batched` is `False`.

    Returns:
        A Tensor containing the loss to minimize, whose rank depends on the
        reduce arguments. For example, the batch dimension is reduced if
        either :attr:`average_across_batch` or :attr:`sum_over_batch` is
        `True`, which decreases the rank of output tensor by 1.
