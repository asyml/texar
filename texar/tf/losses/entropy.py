            (i.e., `distribution_dim`). So the last dimension is always
            summed out to compute the entropy.
        rank (int, optional): The rank of :attr:`logits`.
            If `None` (default), `rank` is inferred automatically from
            `logits`. If the inference fails, `rank` is
            set to 2, i.e., assuming :attr:`logits` is of shape
            `[batch_size, distribution_dim]`
        average_across_batch (bool): If set, average the entropy across the
            batch dimension. Must not set `average_across_batch`'
            and `sum_over_batch` at the same time.
        average_across_remaining (bool): If set, average the entropy across the
            remaining dimensions. Must not set `average_across_remaining`'
            and `sum_over_remaining` at the same time.
            Used only when :attr:`logits` has rank >= 3.
        sum_over_batch (bool): If set, sum the entropy across the
            batch dimension. Must not set `average_across_batch`
            and `sum_over_batch` at the same time.
