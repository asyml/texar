    This is a combination of :func:`~texar.tf.utils.shapes.mask_sequences`
    and :func:`~texar.tf.losses.losses_utils.reduce_batch_time`.

    Args:
        sequence: A Tensor of sequence values.
            If `time_major=False` (default), this must be a Tensor of shape
            `[batch_size, max_time, d_2, ..., d_rank]`, where the rank of
            the Tensor is specified with :attr:`rank`.
            The batch and time dimensions are exchanged if `time_major` is True.
        sequence_length: A Tensor of shape `[batch_size]`. Time steps beyond
            the respective sequence lengths will be made zero. If `None`,
            not masking is performed.
        rank (int): The rank of :attr:`sequence`. Must be >= 2. Default is 2,
            i.e., `sequence` is a 2D Tensor consisting of batch and time
            dimensions.
        average_across_timesteps (bool): If set, average the sequence across
            the time dimension. Must not set `average_across_timesteps`
            and `sum_over_timesteps` at the same time.
        average_across_batch (bool): If set, average the sequence across the
            batch dimension. Must not set `average_across_batch`'
            and `sum_over_batch` at the same time.
        average_across_remaining (bool): If set, average the sequence across the
            remaining dimensions. Must not set `average_across_remaining`'
            and `sum_over_remaining` at the same time.
        sum_over_timesteps (bool): If set, sum the loss across the
            time dimension. Must not set `average_across_timesteps`
            and `sum_over_timesteps` at the same time.
        sum_over_batch (bool): If set, sum the loss across the
            batch dimension. Must not set `average_across_batch`
            and `sum_over_batch` at the same time.
        sum_over_remaining (bool): If set, sum the loss across the
            remaining dimension. Must not set `average_across_remaining`
            and `sum_over_remaining` at the same time.
        time_major (bool): The shape format of the inputs. If `True`,
            :attr:`sequence` must have shape `[max_time, batch_size, ...]`.
            If `False` (default), `sequence` must have
            shape `[batch_size, max_time, ...]`.
        dtype (dtype): Type of :attr:`sequence`. If `None`, infer from
            :attr:`sequence` automatically.

    Returns
        A Tensor containing the masked and reduced sequence.
