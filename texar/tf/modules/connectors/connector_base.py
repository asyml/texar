    transform inputs into outputs with any specified structure and shape.
    For example, tranforming the final state of an encoder to the initial
    state of a decoder, and performing stochastic sampling in between as
    in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs).

    Args:
        output_size: Size of output **excluding** the batch dimension. For
            example, set `output_size` to `dim` to generate output of
            shape `[batch_size, dim]`.
            Can be an `int`, a tuple of `int`, a Tensorshape, or a tuple of
            TensorShapes.
            For example, to transform inputs to have decoder state size, set
            `output_size=decoder.state_size`.
        hparams (dict, optional): Hyperparameters. Missing
            hyperparamerter will be set to default values. See
            :meth:`default_hparams` for the hyperparameter sturcture and
            default values.
