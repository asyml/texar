Python implementation of BLEU and smoothed BLEU adapted from:
    `https://github.com/tensorflow/nmt/blob/master/nmt/scripts/bleu.py`

This module provides a Python implementation of BLEU and smoothed BLEU.
Smooth BLEU is computed following the method outlined in the paper:

    (Lin et al. 2004) ORANGE: a method for evaluating automatic evaluation
    metrics for maching translation.
    Chin-Yew Lin, Franz Josef Och. COLING 2004.
